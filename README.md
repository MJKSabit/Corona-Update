[Intro Video ](https://youtu.be/TznE_pFj-_w)  

is an Android App which shows current situation of corona all over the world.
  
It shows,
- Total Number of **Infected** People

To use the app, you have to be conncted to the **Internet**.
The app gets data from the Internet.  
  
To avoid unneccesary complexity, I didn't add an other facilities like auto refresh.
You can refresh manually by closing and opening the app again.
