# Corona (CoVID-19) Update
is an Android App which shows current situation of corona all over the world.
  
It shows,
- Total Number of **Infected** People
- Total Number of **Recovered** People
- Total number of **Active** cases
- Total number of **Death**

To use the app, you have to be conncted to the **Internet**.
The app gets data from the Internet.  
  
To avoid unneccesary complexity, I didn't add an other facilities like auto refresh.
You can refresh manually by closing and opening the app again.
